---------------------------------
 Maze solver using DFS algorithm
---------------------------------

It only solves the provided maze but i may improve it later.

It randomly generates apples and puan(point) increases by 10 if algorithm finds any.

If algorithm goes to a dead end it loses 5 puan.

Algorithm stops when it founds c(exit) and starts at b(start).
